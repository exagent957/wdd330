    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <p>
      Read the syllabus. </p> <p>Introduced myself on discussion board and provided my
      availability for team meetings. Joined Team 1.</p><p> Reviewed “Doing Stuff With
      Web Things” and read in detail Section 2.3 on local storage. Included
      notes for my personal recall. Computers need help remembering things for
      later recall. Users provide input. HTML uses input tag and textarea tag to
      capture user input. Input can be placed in variables and stored in
      localstorage through JS. To retrieve user input special word ‘value’ is
      used. Use a section tag to show something to the user and include special
      word ‘innerHTML’. (input and textarea => value, section=> innerHTML) JS
      can store information for later use using ‘localStorage’ even after
      refreshing a page or visiting another site. ‘localStorage’ uses key-value
      pairs. I am not sure where it actually gets stored. On the user’s device
      somewhere.</p><p> Watched Master Mobile UX video lesson. Rewire our brains to
      start design with small device first. Not sure what a GZIP file is.</p><p>Followed Brother Chandler's code example to dynamically place a link on portfolio site. Need to dive deeper into JavaScript.</p>
